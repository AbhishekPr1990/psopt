Introduction
------------

This is the PSOPT library, a software tool for computational [optimal control](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Optimal_control)

PSOPT is an open source optimal control package written in C++ that uses direct collocation methods. These methods solve optimal control problems by approximating the time-dependent variables using global or local polynomials. This allows to discretize the differential equations and continuous constraints over a grid of nodes, and to compute any integrals associated with the problem using well known quadrature formulas. [Nonlinear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming) then is used to find local optimal solutions. PSOPT is able to deal with problems with the following characteristics:

-  Single or multiphase problems
-  Continuous time nonlinear dynamics
-  General endpoint constraints
-  Nonlinear path constraints (equalities or inequalities) on states and/or control variables
- Integral constraints
-  Interior point constraints
-  Bounds on controls and state variables
-  General cost function with Lagrange and Mayer terms.
-  Free or fixed initial and final conditions
- Linear or nonlinear linkages between phases
-  Fixed or free initial time
-  Fixed or free final time
- Optimisation of static parameters
- Parameter estimation problems with sampled measurements â€¢ Differential equations with delayed variables.

The implementation has the following features:

- Automatic scaling
- Automatic first and second derivatives using the ADOL-C library
- Numerical differentiation by using sparse finite differences
- Automatic mesh refinement
- Automatic identification of the Jacobian and Hessian sparsity.
- DAE formulation, so that differential and algebraic constraints can be implemented in the same C++ function.

The PSOPT interface uses both Eigen3 (a linear algebra template library) and ADOL-C (an automatic differentiation library).

The PSOPT project webpage is <http://psopt.org>. The first release of PSOPT was published in 2009. This is release 5 of PSOPT.

Getting Started
---------------

Please consult the detailed installation instructions in the [PSOPT PDF documentation](https://github.com/PSOPT/psopt/blob/master/doc/PSOPT_Manual_R5.pdf). In the following, we only summarize some main points.

### Dependencies

PSOPT requires the following libraries:

1. [IPOPT](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt )
2. [ADOL-C](https://github.com/coin-or/ADOL-C)
3. [EIGEN3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)

Optionally, the user may wish to employ the following software
1. [SNOPT](http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/manuals/SNOPT-Manual.pdf)
2. [GNUplot](http://www.gnuplot.info)

Moreover, PSOPT is built using [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. The build process also requires the [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) tool.  

### Build

After installation of dependencies, a typical PSOPT build and installation on a Unix-like operating system follows these steps (please see the PDF documentation for futher details):

1. Download and extract the installation archive from the GItHub project page. Alternatively, the source code can be cloned using git, by issuing the following command: 
         `git clone https://github.com/PSOPT/psopt.git`
2.  `mkdir build; cd build`
3. `cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON .. $ make`
4.  `sudo make install`
